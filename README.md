# Global Ethereum messaging protocol.

### Contract address at ETC chain: [0x6A77417FFeef35ae6fe2E9d6562992bABA47a676](http://gastracker.io/addr/0x6A77417FFeef35ae6fe2E9d6562992bABA47a676)

This repository represents a reference implementation of a central messaging smart-contract that aims to provide a functionality to contact an owner of Ethereum hex-address directly.

This protocol can be used on cross-chain basis since any address can deliver a message for the owner of the address at the alternative chain.
